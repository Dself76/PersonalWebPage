                Hi, I'm Dennis, and I'm passionate about both the great outdoors and the exciting world of IT. Whether it's hiking, fishing, exercising, or just enjoying fresh air, I thrive on outdoor adventures.

                I'm currently pursuing a degree in Computer Science and Software Engineering, with less than a year left to go, maintaining a GPA between 3.8 and 3.9. My academic journey has sparked a deep interest in Mathematics and Natural Language Processing, and Web Development front and backend, alongside my enduring love for all things IT.
                
                From software engineering to machine learning, security, databases, and helpdesk support, I'm constantly exploring and refining my skills. I spend my free time diving into projects with Arduino, Raspberry Pi, and coding, always eager to learn and apply new technologies.
                
                Iâ€™m actively seeking entry-level or internship opportunities in IT to further develop my expertise and contribute to innovative projects. Let's connect and see how we can make an impact together!

            <b>Project Name:</b> Simple Password Manager<br><br>
        </section>
            <b>Language:</b> C++<br><br>
        
            <b>Project Overview:</b><br>
            The Simple Password Manager is a C++ application designed to securely store and manage user passwords. This project aims to provide a basic yet effective solution for handling password storage with a focus on simplicity and security. It demonstrates the fundamental concepts of file handling, encryption, and user authentication in C++.<br><br>
        
            <b>Features:</b><br>
            1. <b>Password Storage:</b> Securely store passwords with associated usernames and services.<br>
            2. <b>Encryption:</b> Implement basic encryption techniques to protect stored passwords.<br>
            3. <b>User Authentication:</b> Ensure that only authorized users can access the stored passwords.<br>
            4. <b>Command-Line Interface:</b> Simple and intuitive command-line interface for user interactions.<br><br>
        
            <b>Project Structure:</b><br>
            - <b>main.cpp:</b> The main entry point of the application.<br>
            - <b>PasswordManager.cpp:</b> Contains the core functionality of the password manager, including methods for adding, retrieving, and encrypting passwords.<br>
            - <b>PasswordManager.h:</b> Header file defining the PasswordManager class and its methods.<br>
            - <b>PasswordManager.sln:</b> Visual Studio solution file for the project.<br>
            - <b>PasswordManager.vcxproj:</b> Visual Studio project file.<br>
            - <b>PasswordManager.vcxproj.filters:</b> Filters file for organizing the project files in Visual Studio.<br>
            - <b>PasswordManager.vcxproj.user:</b> User-specific settings for the Visual Studio project.<br><br>
        
            <b>Development Environment:</b><br>
            - Developed using Visual Studio, leveraging its robust development tools and debugging features.<br>
            - The project is configured to build and run in a Debug configuration on a 64-bit Windows environment.<br><br>
        
            <b>How to Run:</b><br>
            1. Open the PasswordManager.sln solution file in Visual Studio.<br>
            2. Build the project using the provided solution configuration.<br>
            3. Run the compiled executable to start the password manager.<br><br>
        
            <b>Usage:</b><br>
            - <b>Add Password:</b> Store a new password with the associated username and service name.<br>
            - <b>Retrieve Password:</b> Retrieve stored passwords by providing the service name.<br>
            - <b>Encrypt/Decrypt:</b> Basic encryption and decryption functionalities to secure stored passwords.<br><br>
        
            <b>This project helped me with the following Learning Outcomes:</b><br>
            - Understanding of file handling in C++.<br>
            - Implementation of basic encryption techniques.<br>
            - Experience with user authentication mechanisms.<br>
            - Familiarity with developing and debugging C++ applications in Visual Studio.<br><br>
